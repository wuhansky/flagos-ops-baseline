# Sparse log-softmax native H800 baseline

This source prepares two native PyTorch GPU modules for the original297 suite:
`_sparse_log_softmax` and `_sparse_log_softmax_backward_data`. The snapshot `op_pytorch_sparse_log_softmax_h800_perf_baseline.json` contains
40 native CUDA timing records. Existing historical backward records use a different
input recipe and must not be relabelled.

The exact case source is FlagGems `f30a563479449016490ef674b3670ede6c101988`.
The original own benchmark hashes are embedded in each module. Forward has nine
core descriptor variants, backward eleven; both retain float32 and float64 on
H800, so a complete collection contains **18 + 22 = 40 records**. Their original
pytest case IDs, including the backward `_benchmark` suffix, are exported in
`config`. This is not the previous sparse-softmax pair's six-plus-six grid.

Forward uses all four original shapes and every original `(sparse_dim, dim)`
pair, including dense-block reduction axes. Its deterministic grouped support
is sorted and unique, `is_coalesced=True`, and stored count is the original
`min(sparse_extent,8192)` rule. Values have the full trailing dense block.

Backward preserves the eleven descriptors, including duplicate coordinates at
shape4096/nnz8192, dense blocks, scalar nnz1 and nnz0, and empty nnz0. **grad,
output and self are all complete sparse COO tensors** of the descriptor shape,
with equal coordinate content but independent indices/values storage and
independently drawn normal values. Output is not replaced by probabilities or a
computed forward result. Self is not a dense `[1]` placeholder. Original stored
order and automatic empty/singleton coalesced metadata are retained.

## Canonical input recipe

`coo-log-softmax-pcg64-native-width-compact-v1` uses a local NumPy PCG64 generator
seeded by recipe/kind/shape/nnz/sparse_dim/dim/dtype. It changes random payloads
from historical Torch RNG samples. It preserves descriptor/support/independent
normal-value semantics, not historical tensor bits. Float64 draws are generated
at native width, never through float32. No global Python/NumPy/Torch RNG is set.

`ops/pytorch/_sparse_log_softmax_inputs/__init__.py` is a private package, not a
third operator module. Consumers should copy the necessary fixture/interface
code into their two own FlagGems benchmarks; target runtime must not import the
Ops checkout. The public fixture interface consists of `seed_hex`,
`forward_cpu`, `backward_cpu`, `input_identity` and `to_device`.

Input identities cover every defined byte of each compact indices/values
component, dtype, shape, stride, offset, storage extent, lazy flags, sparse/dense
dimensions, stored count, coalesced status, gradient flags and all component
storage-alias pairs. Absolute addresses and device ordinals are intentionally
not cross-machine keys. Transport independently checks the exact requested
physical device and full identity, using byte-preserving copies. Meta tensors
cannot establish physical identity and are not a supported collection target.
All native timing must execute direct CUDA ATen on the actual target inputs;
CPU construction/identity calculation is preparation, **not a timed CPU oracle**.

Bitwise reproducibility across arbitrary NumPy/OS combinations is not assumed.
Target replay must compare actual complete input identity to the H800 config
and reject a mismatch. CPU tests establish no target GPU replay or performance
speedup. This collection used `--no-ncu`; NCU-related placeholder zeros are not
measured compute or bandwidth utilization.

## Collected snapshot

Collected on 2026-10-22 UTC using unchanged H800 runtime and clean producer
commit `0f73cb27eb44781aa75cc2519482701c06f03e1e`. Forward18 and backward22 records both completed successfully.
Source1150 tracked files had identical hashes before/after collection. The
official tool command was:

```sh
python tools/collect_baseline_nvidia.py --repo pytorch \
  --ops _sparse_log_softmax,_sparse_log_softmax_backward_data \
  --devices 7 --no-ncu --op-timeout 1800 \
  --output /data/tj/workspace/ops-baseline-log-softmax-run-v1-20261022/h800.json
```

Independent source and native-collection review verified actual H800 hardware,
clean source/before-after hashes, each original per-op worker environment, all40
case configs, positive finite `T_us`, ms/us units and completed tasks.

The combined artifact stores the last per-device environment. Consumers pin each
operator's original worker environment separately; do not label the last worker
environment as both operators. The publication commit differs from the measured
producer commit above.

Host and container process sampling linked the native workers through NSpid and
cgroup. The41 host and22 container samples had maximum gaps23.165s and29.468s;
these are sampled ownership observations, not continuous exclusive-GPU proof.
No unrelated jobs were stopped and no runtime/driver upgraded. Preserve underscore operator keys explicitly when reading the JSON;
metadata filtering must not drop these two real names. A partial/error task is
not completed native data and absent data is never zero latency. Ops PRs remain
unmerged unless separately authorized.

CPU checks: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p
test_sparse_log_softmax_canonical.py -v`. They exercise all40 config/builder
identities, native CPU literal formulas and readonly inputs, duplicate/scalar/
empty cases, private RNG, exact width/storage/alias checks and corrupted-copy
rejection. Legacy backward manifest membership and all11 descriptors/dtypes
remain tested; its physical canonical inputs are validated on CPU instead of
comparing real bytes to undefined meta tensors. A separate external audit runs
the pinned original coordinate helpers and compares all20 support descriptors.
